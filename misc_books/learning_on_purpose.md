# learning on purpose

This book introduces learning methods that are more efficient

# learning heuristics

## pointers on purposed learning

- a target
    - before learning begins
    - may be decomposed into small check-able targets
- be focus
- feedback
- out of comfort zone
- a strong drive
- on bottleneck, try different methods that may work
- work hard to construct features (as described below)

## features

trained players can make **abstractions** to encode real world info into **features**, memorize fewer and faster.

**features** are:

- based on past experience
- domain specific
- helpful in purposeful learning
- can make good predictions (about future outcomes)

e.g.

- combinations of numbers (in digits memorizing)
- design patterns (in Java)
- certain chess pieces in certain positions (in Chess)
