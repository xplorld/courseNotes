# Planning

## Constraints

Scope, Cost, Time -> Quality.

To keep quality:

- if you ++scope, you have to ++cost or ++time or both
- if you --cost, you have to --scope or ++time
- et cetera

Typical planning: fixed cost and time, plan a possible scope

## multilevel planning

plan in many levels

- (high level)
- solution roadmap (project scope, structure ...)
- release plan
- iteration plan (feature #123)
- daily plan (`class Router`)
- (detailed)

## what to think in planning: risk and value and effort

prioritize to ++value and --risk

### risk list

| risk | priority | what to do |
|-|-|-|

### value

- talk to 客户

## estimation

one may underestime or overestimate, will both costy.

Estimate in **range** (1-2months), not **single point** (1month!), since you cannot make a good single point estimation.

**document all assumptions in estimation.**
