# fight against defects

Why not test only
- test is expensive
- test cannot eliminate all bugs


## defect prevention

sorted from efficient to useless

- reuse code
- formal inspection (super duper formal code review)
- static analysis
- design pattern
- on-site customers
- informal peer reviews
- pair programming (almost useless)

## pre-test defect removal

- formal inspection
- static analysis
- scrum daily meetings

## testing defect removal

## post-release defect removal

Why: eliminate **latent defects** (defects in released software)
